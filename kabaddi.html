               						"><B>Kabaddi</b> is a contact team sport with origins in Ancient India.
 Played between two teamsof seven players, the
	objective of the game is for a single player on offence, referred to asa "raider", to run into  
	the opposing team's half of a court, touch out as many of their defenders as possible, and return 
	to their own half of the court, all without being tackled by the defenders,and in a single breath.
	Points are scored for each player tagged by the raider, while the opposing team earns a point for 
	stopping the raider. </p> 
<p2>Players are taken out of the game  if they are touched or tackled, but are 
	brought back in for each point scored by their team from a tag or tackle.It is popular in the Indian
	subcontinent and other surrounding Asian countries. Although accounts of kabaddi appear in the hisrories 
	of ancient India, the game was popularised as a competitive sport in the 20th century. It is the national 
	sport of Bangladesh. It is the state game of the Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar,
	Haryana,Karnataka,Kerala, Maharashtra,Odisha,Punjab, Telangana,and Uttar Pradesh.There are two major 
	 disciplines of kabaddi: "Punjabi kabaddi", also referred to as "circle styles", comprises traditional
	forms of the sport that are played on a circular field outdoors, while the "standard style", played on
	a rectangular court
	indoors, is the discipline played in major professional leagues and international competitions such as the
 Asian Games.
	This game is known by numerous names in different parts of the Indian subcontinent, such as: kabaddi or 
chedugudu in 
	Andhra Pradesh and Telangana; kabaddi in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala; kabadi or ha-du-du in West
 Bengal and 
	Bangladesh; bhavatik in Maldives, kauddi or kabaddi in the Punjab region; hu-tu-tu in Western India,
